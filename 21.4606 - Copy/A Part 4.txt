Here are the voting recommendations for each person based on their alignment with the environmental goals of the referendum, given the focus on renewable energy and environmental protection:

1. **Age 58**: Moderate support for environmental protection with a slightly higher inclination towards a liberal economy indicates a balanced view. Given the moderate environmental concern, the person might not fully embrace the referendum's goals. **The person should vote no**.

2. **Age 65**: Lower environmental protection concern and higher economic liberalism suggest that the person's values do not strongly align with the environmental objectives of the referendum. **The person should vote no**.

3. **Age 34**: High environmental protection scores and low economic liberalism strongly suggest that the person would support the referendum’s environmental objectives. **The person should vote yes**.

4. **Age 62**: Moderate scores on both scales suggest a balance, but the slight tilt towards environmental protection aligns with the referendum's focus. **The person should vote yes**.

5. **Age 49**: Lower environmental concern and high economic liberalism suggest that the person may not fully support the environmental goals of the referendum. **The person should vote no**.

6. **Age 41**: Similar to the previous, low environmental concern combined with higher economic liberalism suggests a preference away from the referendum's goals. **The person should vote no**.

7. **Age 45**: Lower support for environmental measures and strong economic liberalism indicate that the referendum's focus on environmental protection may not resonate well with this voter. **The person should vote no**.

8. **Age 43**: Very low environmental advocacy with high economic liberalism suggests strong opposition to the environmental focus of the referendum. **The person should vote no**.

9. **Age 56**: Maximum support for environmental protection and very low economic liberalism make this person a strong candidate to support the referendum. **The person should vote yes**.

10. **Age 55**: Moderate environmental concern with lower economic liberalism indicates a slight alignment with the referendum's objectives. **The person should vote yes**.

11. **Age 43**: Very high environmental advocacy with low economic liberalism indicates strong support for the referendum's objectives. **The person should vote yes**.

12. **Age 56**: Lower environmental advocacy combined with moderate economic liberalism suggests the person may not fully support the referendum's environmental goals. **The person should vote no**.

13. **Age 59**: Moderate scores on both axes suggest a balance, but neither is strongly aligned with the referendum's primary focus on environmental protection. **The person should vote yes**, considering the moderate support for both values.

14. **Age 39**: Very low environmental advocacy and high economic liberalism indicate that the person's values are not aligned with the referendum's environmental goals. **The person should vote no**.

15. **Age 68**: Very high environmental advocacy combined with low economic liberalism strongly aligns with the referendum’s environmental goals. **The person should vote yes**.

16. **Age 36**: High environmental scores and moderate economic liberalism suggest strong support for the referendum's environmental objectives. **The person should vote yes**.

17. **Age 56**: High environmental advocacy with lower economic liberalism indicates that the person is likely to support the referendum's environmental goals. **The person should vote yes**.

18. **Age 61**: Moderate scores on both scales suggest a balanced view, but still leaning towards supporting the referendum’s environmental aims. **The person should vote yes**.

19. **Age 51**: Very low environmental concern combined with high economic liberalism indicates a mismatch with the referendum’s environmental focus. **The person should vote no**.

20. **Age 46**: High environmental advocacy combined with moderate economic liberalism suggests a strong alignment with the referendum's goals. **The person should vote yes**.
