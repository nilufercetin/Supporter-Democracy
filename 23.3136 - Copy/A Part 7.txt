Here are the voting recommendations for the five individuals based on their scores in Law and Order, Liberal Society, and Open Foreign Policy:

1. **Age 60** - High score on Law and Order, moderate on Liberal Society, and low on Open Foreign Policy. This profile suggests a preference for maintaining order with less emphasis on liberal or open policies. **The person should vote yes.**

2. **Age 52** - Moderately high on Law and Order, moderate on Liberal Society, and moderate on Open Foreign Policy. This individual shows a balanced view but leans towards law enforcement and some openness, fitting well with a moderate change proposed by the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

3. **Age 57** - Moderate to high on Law and Order, moderate on Liberal Society, but low on Open Foreign Policy. This person prefers traditional law enforcement approaches with less enthusiasm for global openness, which might conflict with the referendum if it promotes increased openness. **The person should vote no.**

4. **Age 45** - Very low on Law and Order but high on both Liberal Society and Open Foreign Policy. This individual strongly supports liberal and open international policies, likely favoring progressive measures in the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

5. **Age 42** - Low on Law and Order, moderate on Liberal Society, and very high on Open Foreign Policy. This profile suggests strong support for openness and moderate liberal values, which would align with a yes vote if the referendum supports these themes. **The person should vote yes.**

These recommendations provide a reasoned approach based on the individual's scores related to their preferences for law enforcement, liberal values, and openness to international engagement, directly aligning with the referendum's focus.
