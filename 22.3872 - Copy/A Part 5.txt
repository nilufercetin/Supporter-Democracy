1. **Person 1 (Age 49):** With a high score on Open Foreign Policy and a moderate score on Liberal Economy, this person generally supports international engagement but is moderate on economic privatization. Given the referendum's focus on aligning with EU standards for worker protection, **the person should vote yes**.

3. **Person 3 (Age 39):** Favoring Open Foreign Policy but less so on Liberal Economy, this person supports international cooperation but prefers some economic regulations, aligning well with the referendum's goals. **The person should vote yes**.

4. **Person 4 (Age 43):** With a low score in Open Foreign Policy and a high in Liberal Economy, this person prefers economic freedom but not international agreements, likely opposing the referendum. **The person should vote no**.
