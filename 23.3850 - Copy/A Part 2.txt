My apologies for the oversight. Let's provide the voting recommendations for all 20 people described:

1. **Age 44**: Moderate scores on all axes, favoring neither extreme regulation nor laissez-faire policies strongly. **The person should vote yes**, aligning with the balanced nature of the proposed changes.

2. **Age 49**: Similar moderate scores with a slight lean towards economic freedom. **The person should vote yes**, as their views align somewhat with the economic aspects of the referendum.

3. **Age 45**: Strongly supports government intervention and regulation, which aligns closely with the referendum's call for controlling rent increases. **The person should vote yes**.

4. **Age 42**: Extreme scores favoring government intervention and maximum welfare, directly supporting the referendum’s intent. **The person should vote yes**.

5. **Age 41**: High scores in financial restraint and economic liberalism, conflicting with the referendum’s approach towards more control. **The person should vote no**.

6. **Age 61**: Mixed views but leans towards economic liberalism and moderate financial policy, which might conflict with the regulatory nature of the referendum. **The person should vote no**.

7. **Age 42**: High economic liberalism, suggesting a preference for less government intervention, conflicting with the referendum. **The person should vote no**.

8. **Age 41**: Very strong support for government intervention, aligning perfectly with the referendum's goals. **The person should vote yes**.

9. **Age 64**: Mixed scores with a slight lean towards more government intervention, aligning somewhat with the referendum. **The person should vote yes**.

10. **Age 54**: Strong support for government intervention in welfare, aligning with the referendum's focus on controlling rent and inflation. **The person should vote yes**.

11. **Age 63**: High support for welfare but low support for financial restraint, suggesting alignment with the referendum's goals. **The person should vote yes**.

12. **Age 36**: Balanced scores with no strong inclination towards or against government intervention, likely neutral but might lean towards a yes due to welfare support. **The person should vote yes**.

13. **Age 48**: Leans towards liberal economic policies but not strongly against government intervention, might find the referendum's measures reasonable. **The person should vote yes**.

14. **Age 56**: Supports both economic freedom and minimal government intervention, which slightly conflicts with the referendum's regulatory nature. **The person should vote no**.

15. **Age 47**: Very strong support for government intervention, directly in line with the referendum. **The person should vote yes**.

16. **Age 39**: Strong liberal economic views and minimal welfare support, opposing the referendum’s regulatory approach. **The person should vote no**.

17. **Age 59**: Moderate scores but leans towards economic liberalism, may see merit in the referendum's approach if it stabilizes the economy. **The person should vote yes**.

18. **Age 43**: Strong support for government intervention and welfare, perfectly aligns with the referendum. **The person should vote yes**.

19. **Age 63**: Support for government intervention in welfare but less so in financial policy, aligns somewhat with the referendum’s focus on rent control. **The person should vote yes**.

20. **Age 42**: Strong liberal economy and restrictive financial policy views, suggesting opposition to increased government control proposed in the referendum. **The person should vote no**.
