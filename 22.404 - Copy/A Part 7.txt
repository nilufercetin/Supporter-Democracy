1. **Age 52** - The person has moderate scores on Restrictive Immigration Policy and relatively low scores on Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society. This suggests a conservative leaning with limited support for expansive welfare measures and liberal policies. Given this alignment, the referendum’s progressive goals may not fully resonate with this person's values. **The person should vote no.**

2. **Age 57** - With a high score on Restrictive Immigration Policy and very low scores on Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society, this individual aligns strongly with conservative views. These measurements suggest opposition to liberal immigration policies and minimal support for expansive social welfare, which are likely at odds with the referendum's objectives. **The person should vote no.**

3. **Age 45** - Low on Restrictive Immigration Policy and high on both Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society, this individual shows strong support for progressive policies that align well with the referendum’s aims of liberalizing immigration policies and enhancing social welfare programs. **The person should vote yes.**

These recommendations take into account the individuals' alignment with the values and aims of the referendum, based on their scores across the three axes.
