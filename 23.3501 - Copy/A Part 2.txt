Certainly! Here are the voting recommendations for the 20 people based on their alignment with the axes of Liberal Society and Expanded Welfare State, and considering the summary of the referendum which focuses on non-binary rights and related societal and welfare considerations:

1. **Age 61** - Moderate scores in both axes suggest a balanced view, but not strongly aligned with progressive changes. **The person should vote no.**

2. **Age 42** - Lower support for an expanded welfare state and moderate on liberal society values indicate a conservative tendency. **The person should vote no.**

3. **Age 41** - High scores on both axes indicate strong support for both liberal society values and expanded welfare measures, aligning with the referendum’s objectives. **The person should vote yes.**

4. **Age 54** - High scores in both axes suggest a strong support for progressive policies. **The person should vote yes.**

5. **Age 63** - High scores on both axes, indicating strong support for liberal societal reforms and welfare expansion. **The person should vote yes.**

6. **Age 36** - High liberalism but moderate on welfare expansion suggests some reservations about extensive state intervention. **The person should vote yes**, leaning towards liberal values.

7. **Age 48** - Moderate to high on liberal society but lower on welfare state expansion, possibly conflicted but more inclined to support liberal values. **The person should vote yes.**

8. **Age 47** - Very high scores on both axes, strongly aligning with the referendum's progressive nature. **The person should vote yes.**

9. **Age 39** - Lower scores especially in expanded welfare state indicate a conservative approach. **The person should vote no.**

10. **Age 63** - Strong support in both axes aligns well with the progressive aspects of the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

11. **Age 42** - Low scores on both axes suggest significant conservative views. **The person should vote no.**

12. **Age 33** - High scores on both axes suggest strong progressive inclinations. **The person should vote yes.**

13. **Age 45** - Maximum scores indicate full support for the issues addressed by the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

14. **Age 65** - High scores on both axes show strong alignment with liberal and welfare expansion ideals. **The person should vote yes.**

15. **Age 48** - Similar to others with high scores, strong support for both key aspects suggests a yes vote. **The person should vote yes.**

16. **Age 60** - Lower support for expanded welfare state and moderate liberalism suggests some reservations about the referendum’s implications. **The person should vote no.**

17. **Age 32** - Very high scores in both dimensions indicate strong support for the proposed changes. **The person should vote yes.**

18. **Age 51** - High scores suggest good alignment with the progressive goals of the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

19. **Age 47** - Again, high scores in both metrics point towards a preference for progressive reforms. **The person should vote yes.**
