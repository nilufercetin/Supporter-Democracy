2. **Age 56**: Although this person has a higher score on Liberal Society, their low score on Expanded Welfare State suggests a mixed view. The predominance in Liberal Society might tilt their preferences slightly. **The person should vote yes.**

3. **Age 33**: High scores on both scales indicate a strong alignment with progressive values and policies likely proposed by the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

4. **Age 57**: Low scores on both scales suggest a conservative approach to both societal liberalism and welfare expansion. **The person should vote no.**

5. **Age 60**: Both scores are low, indicating a conservative leaning and likely resistance to changes proposed in the referendum. **The person should vote no.**

6. **Age 52**: Moderately low scores on both axes suggest a conservative tendency, probably not in favor of the progressive changes in the referendum. **The person should vote no.**

7. **Age 45**: High scores in both categories demonstrate strong support for liberal societal values and expanded welfare state measures. **The person should vote yes.**
