Hi. I will be asking you about how different people should vote on a referendum text I will provide. The people I will ask voting recommendation for will be characterized by their scores in 3 different axes. I will now outline you the meaning and the range of scores of each axis.

1. Restrictive Immigration Policy: The score reflects attitudes towards foreign integration, immigration restrictions, naturalization policies, refugee and asylum policies, and foreign political rights. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 opposes foreign immigration, while 1 supports measures facilitating immigration and integration in Switzerland.

2. Liberal Economy: The score reflects views on privatization, state institution autonomy in essential services (e.g., healthcare, education, food supply), reducing restrictive regulations, promoting competition, and sector-specific subsidies. On a scale from 1 to 5, score of 5 indicates strong support for privatization and unrestricted competition in all sectors, while a score of 1 signifies advocating for state ownership and government-led production and services.

3. Extended Environmental Protection: The score reflects attitudes towards state-supported environmental measures, promotion of renewable energy sources, public transportation expansion, and restrictions on private motorized transport. It also encompasses views on animal welfare, biodiversity, native wildlife reintroduction, and conservation projects. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 indicates strong advocacy for extensive environmental and biodiversity protection measures, while a score of 1 prioritizes economic indicators over natural resource conservation.

Previously, the referendum text is analyzed and it has found out that the axis Restrictive Immigration Policy is the most related to the referendum with a score of 0.45/1, while the axis Liberal Economy is related to the referendum with a relation score of 0.32/1 and the axis Extended Environmental Protection is related to the referendum with a score of 0.23/1. Now that you know about the axes, I will also provide a text summary of the referendum as well. 

The A1 motorway should be widened to at least six lanes on the Bern-Zurich and Lausanne-Geneva sections since there happens to be too much traffic because of uncontrolled immigration.

I will now give out the personal measurements in each axis in lists of people. I would be happy if you could provide analysis as  a few sentences and a final sentence as the person should vote 'yes' or 'no'. Please make sure your analysis and reasoning are sound, coherent, unbiased and inline with the referendum, measurements, axis descriptions and relevance of axes.
