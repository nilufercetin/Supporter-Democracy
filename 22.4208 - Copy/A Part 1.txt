Here are the voting recommendations for each person based on their scores on Expanded Welfare State, Liberal Society, and Liberal Economy in relation to the upcoming referendum on the Equality Act, which focuses primarily on ensuring equal pay analyses in larger workplaces:

1. **Person at age 42:** With moderate scores across all scales, this person seems to balance a liberal view on society and economy with a neutral position on welfare expansion. The referendum, however, leans more towards enhancing employee benefits, which might not be a high priority for this individual. **The person should vote no.**

2. **Person at age 40:** High scores in Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society suggest a strong preference for enhanced employee rights and societal freedoms, aligning closely with the goals of the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

3. **Person at age 61:** Low score on Expanded Welfare State and high on Liberal Economy suggests a preference for less regulation and not expanding state-run programs, which may conflict with the referendum’s approach to impose more regulations on companies. **The person should vote no.**

4. **Person at age 29:** Although they score high on Liberal Society and Economy, their lower score on Expanded Welfare State suggests a reluctance towards increasing employee protections at the cost of possibly increased business regulations. **The person should vote no.**

5. **Person at age 62:** Moderate to high scores in liberal values but lower in welfare expansion suggest a potential conflict with the referendum's focus on enhanced worker protections. **The person should vote no.**

6. **Person at age 51:** Strong support for Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society indicates a strong alignment with the values proposed by the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

7. **Person at age 59:** Very high scores in Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society show a clear preference for the types of policies advocated by the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

8. **Person at age 55:** Mixed scores with a moderate approach to welfare suggest this individual might appreciate the intent behind the referendum but may not fully support its broader implications. **The person should vote no.**

9. **Person at age 47:** A lower score in Expanded Welfare State coupled with higher scores in Liberal Economy suggests a preference for less regulatory interventions, not aligning perfectly with the referendum's goals. **The person should vote no.**

10. **Person at age 43:** High scores in Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society point to a strong preference for increased worker protections and societal freedoms, aligning well with the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

11. **Person at age 58:** Although moderately liberal in society and economy, their lower score in Expanded Welfare State suggests some reservations about the extensive regulatory measures proposed. **The person should vote no.**

12. **Person at age 55:** With high scores in Liberal Economy and moderate scores elsewhere, this person may appreciate the economic freedoms but be less enthusiastic about expanding employee protections. **The person should vote no.**

13. **Person at age 32:** Low score in Expanded Welfare State but high in Liberal Economy indicates a preference for economic liberalism over employee protections. **The person should vote no.**

14. **Person at age 41:** Higher scores in Liberal Economy with moderate scores in Expanded Welfare State suggest a balanced but cautious approach to economic regulations, possibly conflicting with the referendum’s goals. **The person should vote no.**

15. **Person at age 61:** Moderate scores across all axes suggest this individual balances liberal economic views with a moderate stance on welfare, possibly finding the referendum’s approach slightly too aggressive. **The person should vote no.**

16. **Person at age 66:** High scores in Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society align well with the referendum's goals to increase employee protections. **The person should vote yes.**

17. **Person at age 69:** Very high scores in Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society strongly align with the referendum’s focus on enhancing worker protections. **The person should vote yes.**

18. **Person at age 57:** Moderate to low scores in Expanded Welfare State suggest a preference for less government intervention, which could conflict with the referendum's objectives. **The person should vote no.**

19. **Person at age 37:** High scores in Expanded Welfare State and Liberal Society strongly support the referendum's goals of enhancing worker protections. **The person should vote yes.**

20. **Person at age 49:** Moderate scores across all axes indicate a balanced view, but the moderate score in Expanded Welfare State suggests some reservations about increasing regulations on businesses. **The person should vote no.**

These recommendations take into account each person's individual scoring tendencies and how they might align with the intentions behind the referendum based on the outlined axes.
