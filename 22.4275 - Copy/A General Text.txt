Hi. I will be asking you about how different people should vote on a referendum text I will provide. The people I will ask voting recommendation for will be characterized by their scores in 1 axis. I will now outline you the meaning and the range of scores in this axis.

1. Extended Environmental Protection: The score reflects attitudes towards state-supported environmental measures, promotion of renewable energy sources, public transportation expansion, and restrictions on private motorized transport. It also encompasses views on animal welfare, biodiversity, native wildlife reintroduction, and conservation projects. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 indicates strong advocacy for extensive environmental and biodiversity protection measures, while a score of 1 prioritizes economic indicators over natural resource conservation. 

I will also provide a text summary of the referendum as well. 

By this referendum, the Federal Council is responsible for studying the introduction of a CO2 label on all unprocessed foodstuffs. This label must take into account the method of production and the mode of transport of the food. The unit of measurement will be grams of CO2 per kilo of merchandise. With these, the referendum aims to fight greenhouse gas emissions and help inform conscious consumers.

I will now give out the personal measurements the axis in lists of people. I would be happy if you could provide analysis as  a few sentences and a final sentence as the person should vote 'yes' or 'no'. Please make sure your analysis and reasoning are sound, coherent, unbiased and inline with the referendum, measurements, axis descriptions and relevance of axes.
