Here are the voting recommendations for the three individuals based on their scores in Extended Environmental Protection and Restrictive Financial Policy, taking into account the context of the referendum:

1. **Age 57** - The person has a very low score on Extended Environmental Protection and a high score on Restrictive Financial Policy, indicating a preference for limited government spending and low priority for environmental measures. This alignment suggests opposition to initiatives that may increase government intervention or spending on environmental issues. **The person should vote no.**

2. **Age 45** - With a high score on Extended Environmental Protection and a low score on Restrictive Financial Policy, this individual shows strong support for environmental protection and less concern about the financial implications of increased government spending in this area. This suggests strong alignment with the goals of the referendum if it involves environmental protection measures. **The person should vote yes.**

3. **Age 42** - The moderate scores on both scales suggest a balanced view on both environmental protection and financial conservatism. However, the score on Extended Environmental Protection slightly outweighs that on Restrictive Financial Policy, indicating a mild inclination towards supporting environmental initiatives. **The person should vote yes.**

These recommendations provide a reasoned approach based on the individual's scores related to their environmental and financial values, directly aligning with the referendum's focus.
