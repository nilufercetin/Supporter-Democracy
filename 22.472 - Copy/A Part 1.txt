Thank you for providing the detailed information and measurements for each person. Here are the voting recommendations based on their alignment with the key issues of the referendum:

1. **Person at age 42**
   - With moderate scores on all axes, the person holds somewhat balanced views without a strong inclination towards a fully expanded welfare state. The higher scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy suggest a preference for controlled government spending and economic freedom which might conflict slightly with the referendum's aim to expand government-funded vocational training. **The person should vote no.**

2. **Person at age 62**
   - This person leans significantly towards a liberal economic model and restrictive financial policies, indicating a preference for limited government intervention. The lower score on Expanded Welfare State also suggests less support for increasing government-funded programs. **The person should vote no.**

3. **Person at age 40**
   - High support for an expanded welfare state and low scores on liberal economy and restrictive financial policy indicate a strong preference for government intervention and funding in areas like vocational training. **The person should vote yes.**

4. **Person at age 52**
   - Moderate to slightly conservative scores across the board suggest a balance but with a lean towards economic freedom and some control over financial policy. The alignment is not strongly in favor of expanding welfare programs heavily. **The person should vote no.**

5. **Person at age 61**
   - Very low support for an expanded welfare state and high scores in liberal economy and restrictive financial practices suggest a strong preference against increasing government-sponsored programs. **The person should vote no.**

6. **Person at age 29**
   - The person's scores show a preference for economic freedom and financial conservatism over expanded welfare. This alignment suggests less support for the referendum's focus on government-funded training programs. **The person should vote no.**

7. **Person at age 62**
   - Moderate to low support for expanded welfare and higher scores in the other two axes indicate a preference for limited government spending and more economic freedom, likely opposing the proposed funding in the referendum. **The person should vote no.**

8. **Person at age 51**
   - Very high support for expanded welfare state and low scores on liberal economy and restrictive financial policy strongly align with the referendum's goal of government-funded vocational training. **The person should vote yes.**

9. **Person at age 59**
   - Similar to the previous, high scores in expanded welfare state and low in liberal economy and restrictive financial policy indicate strong support for government intervention and funding. **The person should vote yes.**

    - Low score in expanded welfare state and high scores in liberal economy and restrictive financial policy show a preference for less government intervention, which is not in line with the referendum's proposition. **The person should vote no.**
