Thank you for the comprehensive breakdown of the individual measurements and the details about the referendum. Here are the voting recommendations based on the scores in Expanded Welfare State, Liberal Economy, and Restrictive Financial Policy:

1. **Age 42**: Given their moderate scores across the board with a higher inclination towards a liberal economy and restrictive financial policy, this person's values align more with efficiency and less state intervention in social services, which seems to be contrary to the referendum's focus on increasing welfare state interventions. **The person should vote no.**

2. **Age 62**: This individual's high scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy suggest a preference for less government spending and more privatization, which conflicts with the referendum's aim of reducing work hours with state compensation. **The person should vote no.**

3. **Age 40**: With a very high score in Expanded Welfare State and low scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy, this person strongly supports increased government intervention and social welfare programs, aligning perfectly with the referendum's goals. **The person should vote yes.**

4. **Age 52**: The scores indicate a preference for economic liberalism and financial restraint which might not fully align with the social welfare aims of the referendum. **The person should vote no.**

5. **Age 61**: The very low score in Expanded Welfare State and high scores in other areas indicate a preference against expanding government-funded welfare, which is contradictory to the referendum's proposals. **The person should vote no.**

6. **Age 29**: This person's low welfare state score alongside high scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy suggests they prefer less government intervention, which the referendum does not support. **The person should vote no.**

7. **Age 62**: Similar to the previous, a low score in Expanded Welfare State and higher scores in economic conservatism suggest a no vote aligns with their views. **The person should vote no.**

8. **Age 51**: Very high support for the Expanded Welfare State and low support for a Liberal Economy strongly aligns with the referendum’s focus on increased social welfare. **The person should vote yes.**

9. **Age 59**: This individual's high score in Expanded Welfare State and low in Liberal Economy indicates strong support for the referendum’s welfare-enhancing policies. **The person should vote yes.**

10. **Age 55**: Moderate scores across the board but a slight lean towards a Liberal Economy suggest a potential mismatch with the referendum’s welfare expansions. **The person should vote no.**

11. **Age 47**: Low Expanded Welfare State and high Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy scores suggest opposing views to the referendum's aims. **The person should vote no.**

12. **Age 43**: Very high score in Expanded Welfare State and low in Liberal Economy indicates strong support for increasing social welfare provisions. **The person should vote yes.**

13. **Age 58**: Moderate scores, slightly leaning towards a Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy suggest this person may not fully support the welfare expansion proposed. **The person should vote no.**

14. **Age 55**: Low Expanded Welfare State score and high scores in other areas indicate preferences against the referendum's goals. **The person should vote no.**

15. **Age 32**: Very low score in Expanded Welfare State and high scores in other areas strongly suggest opposition to the referendum’s proposals. **The person should vote no.**

16. **Age 41**: Moderate to high scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy indicate a preference for less state intervention, not aligning with the referendum's welfare focus. **The person should vote no.**

17. **Age 61**: Moderate Expanded Welfare State score and somewhat balanced other scores suggest a slight alignment with the referendum’s goals. **The person should vote yes.**

18. **Age 66**: Very high score in Expanded Welfare State and low in Liberal Economy strongly supports the referendum’s welfare-oriented proposals. **The person should vote yes.**

19. **Age 69**: High Expanded Welfare State score and very low scores in other areas show strong support for expanded social welfare, aligning with the referendum. **The person should vote yes.**

20. **Age 57**: Moderate to high scores across the board suggest a balanced view but with a slight lean towards economic liberalism, which might not align perfectly with the welfare expansions proposed. **The person should vote no.**

These recommendations are based on the assumption that the higher the score in Expanded Welfare State, the more likely the individual would support the referendum due to its alignment with increased state intervention in social welfare, while higher scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy would suggest a no vote due to their preference for less government spending and intervention.
