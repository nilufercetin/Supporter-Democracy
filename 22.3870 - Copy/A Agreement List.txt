REASONS
3 axes sometimes made it harder to correctly use all the given information, used Liberal Economy and Law and Order as it seems to fit so there are incoherencies
Ofcourse a bias to provide 'yes' as answer, that is why can give moderate to high instead of high or lower score instead of just low
Some values again got udnerstood wrong just like GPT3.5
At the expense of shorter answers the decision logic becomes comparing first two cleavage scores
