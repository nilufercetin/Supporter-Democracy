Let's analyze the provided scores for each person against the context of the referendum, which focuses on enhancing price transparency in the food market to ensure affordable, quality food access and prevent a food crisis. Here's how the scores on Liberal Economy, Expanded Welfare State, and Law and Order would influence each person's voting decision:

1. **Person at age 42**: Moderate support for liberal economy policies and somewhat lower support for expanded welfare suggests they value market solutions but are not opposed to government intervention. Moderately high score in Law and Order suggests they value stability and government oversight. **Recommendation: Vote yes** to support government intervention for food price transparency.

2. **Person at age 40**: Low score in Liberal Economy and high score in Expanded Welfare State indicate strong support for government intervention in markets and social programs, coupled with low emphasis on strict law enforcement. **Recommendation: Vote yes** as the referendum aligns with their preference for government oversight and intervention.

3. **Person at age 52**: Moderate to high scores across all axes suggest a balanced view favoring some liberal economic policies with reasonable support for government intervention and law enforcement. **Recommendation: Vote yes** as they seem to support balanced government intervention in economic matters.

4. **Person at age 61**: High scores in Liberal Economy and Law and Order indicate strong support for market freedoms and robust law enforcement, but very low support for welfare suggests minimal desire for government intervention in social services. **Recommendation: Vote no**, as they might view the referendum as unnecessary government overreach.

5. **Person at age 29**: High score in Liberal Economy with moderate scores in Expanded Welfare State and lower in Law and Order suggest a preference for market solutions but some openness to government intervention. **Recommendation: Vote yes**, acknowledging the need for some government role in ensuring market transparency.

6. **Person at age 62**: Moderate to high scores in Liberal Economy and Law and Order with low score in Expanded Welfare State suggest a preference for market mechanisms and strong law enforcement with less emphasis on government welfare. **Recommendation: Vote no**, as they likely prefer market solutions over government reports and interventions.

7. **Person at age 51**: Low Liberal Economy and high Expanded Welfare State scores with low Law and Order indicate strong support for government intervention in economic matters and social welfare with less emphasis on stringent law enforcement. **Recommendation: Vote yes** as the referendum aligns with their values of government involvement in economic regulation.

8. **Person at age 59**: Similar to above, low Liberal Economy and high Expanded Welfare State scores suggest strong support for government interventions and social programs. **Recommendation: Vote yes** as the referendum supports their views on government's role in economic fairness.

9. **Person at age 55**: Moderate scores across all dimensions suggest a balanced approach to economic policy, welfare state, and law enforcement. **Recommendation: Vote yes**, considering their moderate support for government intervention aligns with the goals of the referendum.

10. **Person at age 47**: High Liberal Economy and Law and Order scores with lower Expanded Welfare State suggest a preference for market solutions and strong law enforcement but less support for extensive government welfare. **Recommendation: Vote no**, due to their preference for market regulation over government intervention.

11. **Person at age 43**: High Expanded Welfare State score with low Liberal Economy indicates strong support for government interventions and social programs, less emphasis on market freedom. **Recommendation: Vote yes** as they likely support the referendum's focus on government action for economic transparency.
