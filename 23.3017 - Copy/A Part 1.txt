1. **Person at age 42**: With scores leaning slightly lower on the Expanded Welfare State (2.13), this individual may not fully prioritize bolstered security and stricter laws, which could indirectly influence perspectives on funding for policies like the "Equality Strategy 2030". Moderate to higher scores on Liberal Society (3.26) and Restrictive Financial Policy (3.29) suggest a preference for some freedom but also financial conservatism. Given the moderate opposition to expanded welfare and the importance of financial prudence, **the person should vote no**.

2. **Person at age 62**: This individual scores slightly below average on Expanded Welfare State (2.47), showing limited support for increased security measures or governmental intervention in safety. The score on Liberal Society (2.64) suggests some restrictions on personal freedoms are acceptable, and a high score on Restrictive Financial Policy (3.9) strongly favors financial conservatism. The referendum's focus on funding for equality could be seen as contradictory to their financial views, **the person should vote no**.

3. **Person at age 40**: High scores in both Expanded Welfare State (4.9) and Liberal Society (4.69) indicate strong support for government intervention and personal freedoms, which align with the aims of the referendum. The lower score on Restrictive Financial Policy (2.0) suggests this individual favors increased spending, aligning with the referendum’s funding goals. **The person should vote yes**.

4. **Person at age 52**: With a lower score on Expanded Welfare State (2.67) and a somewhat restrictive view on Liberal Society (2.44), this person seems cautious about extensive government intervention and personal freedoms.

This individual's scores suggest a conservative approach to changes in policy and funding, **the person should vote no**.

5. **Person at age 61**: Very low score on Expanded Welfare State (1.4) suggests a strong opposition to increased governmental intervention, which is crucial in the context of the referendum.

6. **Person at age 29**: This individual’s low score on Expanded Welfare State (1.97) and high score on Liberal Society (4.08) indicate a preference for minimal government intervention but strong personal freedoms, which might align with the goals of the referendum.

7. **Person at age 51**: Very high scores in both Expanded Welfare State (4.9) and Liberal Society (4.54), combined with a low score on Restrictive Financial Policy (1.81), indicate strong support for government interventions and spending on social issues.

8. **Person at age 59**: Similar to the previous, high scores on Expanded Welfare State (4.6) and Liberal Society (4.56) with a low score on Restrictive Financial Policy (1.88) suggest a strong inclination towards government intervention and spending in areas like equality, directly aligning with the referendum’s objectives. **The person should vote yes**.

9. **Person at age 47**: A lower score on Expanded Welfare State (1.57) suggests this individual does not favor increasing government roles in public safety or other areas, which may indirectly relate to their view on funding for equality policies.
