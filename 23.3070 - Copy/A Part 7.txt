Here are the voting recommendations for the four individuals based on their scores in the defined scales:

1. **Age 52**: This person shows a preference towards a liberal economic approach with moderate restraint in financial policy, but a low preference for an expanded welfare state. Given their leanings towards more market freedom and less government intervention in welfare, **the person should vote no** on the referendum which potentially involves increased government intervention in economic matters.

2. **Age 57**: With very high scores in Liberal Economy and high scores in Restrictive Financial Policy, combined with a very low score in Expanded Welfare State, this person clearly supports market freedoms and limited government welfare. This alignment suggests they favor less intervention. **The person should vote no**.

3. **Age 45**: This individual scores low on Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy but very high on Expanded Welfare State, indicating a strong preference for substantial government intervention in welfare and less enthusiasm for market-driven economic policies. This profile suggests a preference for increased government role in welfare, which the referendum seems to address. **The person should vote yes**.

4. **Age 42**: With moderate scores in Liberal Economy and Restrictive Financial Policy, but a high score in Expanded Welfare State, this person seems to support a significant role for government in welfare, despite a somewhat balanced view on economic liberalism. The high welfare score suggests a leaning towards government intervention. **The person should vote yes**.

These recommendations are structured to reflect each person's alignment with the possible implications of the referendum based on their scores across the three scales.
