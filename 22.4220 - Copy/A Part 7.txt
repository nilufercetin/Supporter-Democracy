2. **Age 45:** With a high score on Liberal Society and very low scores on Law and Order and Restrictive Financial Policy, this person clearly favors freedom over structure and financial restraint. This profile suggests a likely disagreement with the goals of the referendum, which leans towards more control and financial regulation. **The person should vote no.**

3. **Age 42:** The scores show a moderate leaning towards Liberal Society with relatively lower scores on Law and Order and Restrictive Financial Policy. This individual appears to prefer less stringent controls, which might not fully align with the increased controls proposed in the referendum. **The person should vote no.**

These recommendations are based on each person's inclination towards or against the regulatory and financial control themes central to the referendum, ensuring the advice aligns with their personal predispositions as measured by the scales.
