Here are the voting recommendations based on the scores in Open Foreign Policy, Restrictive Financial Policy, and Liberal Economy:

1. **Age 42**: With a balanced score in all three axes, this person seems to appreciate moderate engagement with international bodies and moderate economic policies. Given the referendum's alignment with broader international compliance, **the person should vote yes**.

2. **Age 62**: Low support for open foreign policy but high support for liberal economic policies indicates a preference for less international control but more free market practices. Since the referendum may impose stricter controls, **the person should vote no**.

3. **Age 40**: Moderate support for open foreign policy and very low support for liberal economy suggests a preference for regulation over free market extremes. This aligns with the referendum's intent to regulate international bodies more tightly. **The person should vote yes**.

4. **Age 52**: Low support for open foreign policy combined with higher scores in liberal economy and restrictive financial policy suggests a preference for economic freedom but less international engagement. **The person should vote no**.

5. **Age 61**: Very low support for open foreign policy combined with high liberal economic values suggests a preference for economic freedom without international oversight, conflicting with the referendum’s intent. **The person should vote no**.

6. **Age 29**: High scores across the board indicate a preference for open engagement and liberal economic policies. Since the referendum could increase regulation, this might be at odds with their views. **The person should vote no**.

7. **Age 51**: Mixed scores with a low score in liberal economy but moderate in open foreign policy suggest confusion or mixed feelings about international regulation. Since the person leans towards regulation in financial policy, **the person should vote yes**.

8. **Age 59**: Moderate to low scores suggest a preference for less international control and moderate financial policy, which may align with regulating international bodies like FIFA. **The person should vote yes**.

9. **Age 47**: Low support for open foreign policy but high scores in liberal economy and restrictive financial policy suggest they favor economic freedom but not international engagement, conflicting with the referendum. **the person should vote no**.

10. **Age 43**: Moderate to low scores overall suggest some reservation towards both open foreign and liberal economic policies, which might indicate support for more stringent controls proposed by the referendum. **The person should vote yes**.

11. **Age 58**: High scores in open foreign policy but moderate in liberal economy suggest they value international engagement but are cautious about economic liberalism, which aligns with the referendum's intent for more control. **The person should vote yes**.

12. **Age 55**: High scores particularly in open foreign policy and liberal economy suggest a strong preference for engagement and economic freedom, which may conflict with the increased regulation proposed. **The person should vote no**.

13. **Age 32**: Low support for open foreign policy but high scores in restrictive financial policy and liberal economy suggests a contradiction in their preferences, leaning towards less international engagement. **The person should vote no**.

14. **Age 41**: Low to moderate scores across the axes suggest caution towards both international engagement and economic liberalism, possibly aligning with the referendum's stricter regulations. **The person should vote yes**.

15. **Age 61**: Moderate scores with a slight lean towards restrictive policies suggest a preference that may align with the referendum’s regulatory intent. **The person should vote yes**.

16. **Age 66**: High in open foreign policy but low in liberal economy suggests conflicting views, but the overall high score in foreign policy might lean them towards supporting the referendum’s international engagement aspect. **The person should vote yes**.

17. **Age 69**: Moderate to low scores suggest a preference for more regulation and less economic liberalism, aligning with the referendum's intent. **The person should vote yes**.

18. **Age 57**: Very low support for open foreign policy combined with high scores in liberal economy and restrictive financial policy indicates a preference for economic autonomy which may conflict with the referendum's regulation. **The person should vote no**.

19. **Age 37**: Moderate scores with a leaning towards less open foreign policy but more economic freedom suggest mixed feelings but a potential alignment with the referendum’s regulatory approach. **The person should vote yes**.

20. **Age 44**: Low support for open foreign policy but higher scores in restrictive financial policy and liberal economy suggest a preference for economic freedom, which might conflict with the regulatory nature of the referendum. **The person should vote no**.
