INCORRECT DECISIONS BOTH IN NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE

REASONS
In reality (left-wing) people who are high in Open Foreign Policy, low in Restrictive Financial Policy and Liberal Economy voted 'Yes'

Agent attributes Open Foreign Policy to a 'Yes' vote which in reality holds true and increases performance
