1. Extended Environmental Protection: 1.0. The referendum discusses biodiversity promotion areas and agricultural land, which are related to environmental measures and biodiversity â€” key components of this axis.

2. Liberal Economy: 0.8. The text involves the management of agricultural land, which can fall under the broad category of economic policy. Changes such as these can influence competition and the supply of food, making it relevant to this axis.

3. Restrictive Financial Policy: 0.3. There might be implications on government spending and budgeting related to the maintenance and management of biodiversity promotion areas, making this axis slightly relevant.

4. Open Foreign Policy: 0.2. Implications on international trade, particularly that involving agricultural goods, could possibly be affected here. However, its relevance is lower as international affairs seem not to be the primary concern of the referendum.

5. Expanded Welfare State: 0.2. Changes in land use could potentially influence state social programs related to agriculture, but the connection is indirect and thus relevance is lower.

6. Law and Order: 0.1. There may be loose relevance to this axis due to potential impacts on regulations managing agricultural land.

7. Restrictive Immigration Policy: 0.0. The referendum does not appear to touch on matters regarding immigration or foreign integration.

8. Liberal Society: 0.0. The referendum does not touch explicitly on societal freedom or personal lifestyle, making this axis irrelevant.
