Based on the provided information, here's the relevance ranking:

1. Liberal Economy: The referendum talks about increasing indigenous production, indicating deregulation or state institution autonomy in essential services like food supply. There could also be implications related to competition and subsidies for certain sectors, such as agriculture. Relevance Score: 0.9

2. Extended Environmental Protection: The repurposing of fallow land and ecological contributions impacts the environment, indicating a trade-off between industrial development and maintaining biodiversity, environmental measures, and animal welfare. Relevance Score: 0.8 

3. Restrictive Financial Policy: Implementing new strategies for increasing agricultural production might require new spending proposals or budget changes from the government. Relevance Score: 0.7

4. Expanded Welfare State: Adjusting the accessibility and extent of food supply may indirectly relate to state social benefits and government social programs, as this could impact the welfare of citizens. Relevance Score: 0.5

5. Open Foreign Policy: The casual mention of the "insecurity situation in Europe" suggests some relevance to this axis, as Switzerland's engagement with the EU and other international organizations might be part of the context. However, it's not the central issue. Relevance Score: 0.4

6. Restrictive Immigration Policy: This is less directly relevant, but an underlying issue could be the contribution of foreign workers to agricultural production and thus to the countryâ€™s economy. Relevance Score: 0.3

7. Law and Order: This concept seems vaguely connected to the referendum content; it may come into play to ensure that changes in land use and ecological preservation are followed. Relevance Score: 0.2

8. Liberal Society: At face value, the referendum does not directly pertain to matters of personal lifestyle freedom, religious beliefs, or private matters. However, in an interconnected society, an agricultural policy could theoretically have downstream impacts on societal conditions. Relevance Score: 0.1
