1. **Restrictive Immigration Policy:** This is the most relevant axis, as the referendum is directly about changing current immigration restrictions, in particular, those regarding naturalization. So it gets a relevance score of 1. 

2. **Expanded Welfare State:** Also relevant, as easing naturalization procedures can be seen as improving accessible state social benefits for certain residents. Score: 0.6.

3. **Liberal Society:** It has relevance as easier naturalization processes can be linked to personal lifestyle freedom and matters related to the right to a nationality. Score: 0.6.

4. **Open Foreign Policy:** Somewhat relevant, as changes in immigration policy could reflect on Switzerland's engagement with international organizations and bilateral agreements. Score: 0.4.

5. **Liberal Economy:** The relevance is low. While changes to citizenship requirements could potentially affect the labor market and, subsequently, the economy, the connection is indirect. Score: 0.2.

6. **Restrictive Financial Policy:** Quite indirect relevance, as costs of implementing changes to naturalization procedures could affect government spendings. However, this is not directly addressed in the referendum text. Score: 0.1.

7. **Law and Order:** The relevance is low, as the referendum does not directly address issues of public safety measures or criminal law. Score: 0.1.

8. **Extended Environmental Protection:** There is no relevance of this axis to the referendum, as it has no relation with environmental matters. Score: 0.0.
