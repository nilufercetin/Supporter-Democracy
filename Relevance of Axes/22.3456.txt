Measures are being proposed to scrutinize foreign investors more closely, indicating a more guarded position toward international engagement. Relevance Score: 0.9.

3. Restrictive Financial Policy: The focus on preventing risky financial activities also aligns with a restrictive financial policy, suggesting more control and regulation are needed in financial affairs. Relevance Score: 0.7.

4. Liberal Economy: While not the central theme, the notion of foreign investments in Swiss companies does hold economic implications, albeit primarily related to regulatory aspects rather than proposals advocating for a liberal economy. Relevance Score: 0.6.

5. Restrictive Immigration Policy: The issue of foreign participation indirectly ties with immigration policies, however, it's not directly reflecting views on foreign integration, immigration restrictions, etc., but rather focuses on foreign economic influence. Relevance Score: 0.3.
