1. Open Foreign Policy: The referendum directly asks for an investigation into alignment with EU laws, which falls broadly under Switzerland's engagement with the EU. Relevance Score: 0.95
2. Liberal Economy: A secondary aspect of the referendum is the impact of the said laws on economic structuresâ€”for example, if the laws affect business competitiveness or require new subsidies. However, it is not the main focus. Relevance Score: 0.55
3. Restrictive Financial Policy: Although laws could require government expenditure to be implemented, this is not explicitly mentioned in the referendum. Relevance Score: 0.4
4. Law and Order: While worker protection laws could cross over with criminal law, there is no clear mention of public safety measures or government interventions in specific. Relevance Score: 0.35
5. Restrictive Immigration Policy: The referendum makes no direct reference to immigration, naturalization, or foreign political rights. Relevance Score: 0.1
6. Extended Environmental Protection: Whilst worker protection could potentially involve environmental measures at the workplace, the referenced EU-Swiss law comparisons are not about environmental protection. Relevance Score: 0.15
7. Expanded Welfare State: As the referendum focuses on worker protections and rights, which could include state social benefits, its relevance falls under this axis. Relevance Score: 0.85
8. Liberal Society: Although worker protection can be part of a liberal society, the text does not touch on personal freedoms, privacy, religion, or belief. Relevance Score: 0.25
