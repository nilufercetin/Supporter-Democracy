Based on the text of the referendum, here's the relevance of each axis from most to least:

1. Liberal Economy: Relevance score 0.9 out of 1. The most important axis as it largely addresses economic structure, and transparency in multinational companies can significantly impact privatization, competition, and sector-specific subsidies.

2. Restrictive Financial Policy: Relevance score 0.8 out of 1. The referendum discusses aspects of companies' financial flows and tax rulings, which directly link to government financial policies.

3. Law and Order: Relevance score 0.7 out of 1. This is important as transparency measures would need to be upheld by regulations and laws.

4. Liberal Society: Relevance score 0.6 out of 1. The topic of transparency, privacy, and data is addressed here which makes it relevant.

5. Open Foreign Policy: Relevance score 0.4 out of 1. This is somewhat relevant since multinationals typically involve foreign elements, but the main focus here is not Switzerland's relations with foreign entities.

6. Expanded Welfare State: Relevance score 0.3 out of 1. There's a loose connection as transparent multinational activities can influence the state's social services indirectly through taxes.

7. Restrictive Immigration Policy: Relevance score 0.2 out of 1. The connection is tenuous since multinational operations may impact immigration policy indirectly through job opportunities, but it's not a direct focus of the referendum.

8. Extended Environmental Protection: Relevance score 0.1 out of 1. This axis has the least relevance because the referendum doesn't address environmental or conservation policies directly.
