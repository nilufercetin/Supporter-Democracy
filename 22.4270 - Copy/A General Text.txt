Hi. I will be asking you about how different people should vote on a referendum text I will provide. The people I will ask voting recommendation for will be characterized by their scores in 3 different axes. I will now outline you the meaning and the range of scores of each axis.

1. Law and Order: The score reflects attitudes towards public safety measures, including government interventions, criminal law effectiveness, and personal self-defense rights. On a scale of 1 to 5, a score of 5 suggests support for stricter laws and bolstered security forces, while a score of 1 indicates opposition to these measures, advocating that existing laws and security forces are sufficient for maintaining public safety in Switzerland. 

2. Restrictive Financial Policy: The score reflects the attitudes towards government spending proposals, including austerity measures, budget changes, and tax adjustments. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 indicates advocating for restricted spending across all sectors, while a score of 1 suggests advocating for increased government spending to enhance citizen access to services.

3. Open Foreign Policy: The score reflects the stance on Switzerland's engagement with the European Union, other international organizations, and global trade. It summarizes views on commitments to bilateral agreements, cooperation with foreign armed forces, and free trade. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 indicates full support for Switzerland's compliance with agreements and cooperation with international bodies, while a score of 1 signifies opposition to such engagement, preferring independence from international organizations and trade agreements.

Previously, the referendum text is analyzed and it has found out that the axis Law and Order is the most related to the referendum with a score of 0.4/1, while the axis Restrictive Financial Policy is related to the referendum with a relation score of 0.32/1 and the axis Open Foreign Policy is related to the referendum with a relation score of 0.28/1. Now that you know about the axes, I will also provide a text summary of the referendum as well. 

By this referendum, the Federal Council should create an entity which is provided with specific financial resources from the DDPS budget. This entity should be responsible for carrying out innovation projects in terms of security, defense and technology which would retain talents in Switzerland and limit the country"s dependence on certain external partners.

I will now give out the personal measurements in each axis in lists of people. I would be happy if you could provide analysis as  a few sentences and a final sentence as the person should vote 'yes' or 'no'. Please make sure your analysis and reasoning are sound, coherent, unbiased and inline with the referendum, measurements, axis descriptions and relevance of axes.
