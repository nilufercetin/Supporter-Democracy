REASONS
It is inferred that the newly created agency will be international which I did not understand how it is inferred but because of correlation actually high Open Foreign Policy individuals voted 'Yes'
In reality High Law and Order and High Restrictive Financial Policy has voted 'No' but this may be because of shear one of the axes
Three axes got the agent to mess up sometimes it is inconsistent how the decision changes for each axis
