Please try to be coherent and as unbiased as possible. Your answer needs to be structured as an explanation based on the measurements of the person and a final sentence as "the person should vote <vote>". Here are the measurements:

Based on the provided measurements, here are the voting recommendations for each person:



2. **Person at age 57**: The higher scores in Law and Order and Restrictive Financial Policy indicate a preference for stronger security measures and controlled financial policies, which align with parts of the referendum. However, the low score in Open Foreign Policy suggests some reservations about increasing international cooperation, which is also a component of the referendum. Given the low score in an important area related to the referendum, and considering the greater weight of Law and Order and Restrictive Financial Policy, **the person should vote yes**, as the primary concerns are more aligned with the referendum's intent.

3. **Person at age 45**: With very low scores in Law and Order and Restrictive Financial Policy but a high score in Open Foreign Policy, this person seems to prefer less emphasis on stringent security measures and financial restrictions but is very supportive of international engagement. Given that the referendum also aims to enhance Switzerland's independence from certain external partners while boosting security and technology, this could contradict the person's high preference for open foreign policies. Since their highest priority conflicts with key aspects of the referendum, **the person should vote no**.

These recommendations consider the scores on each axis relative to the content and aims of the referendum, providing a rationale based on the individualâ€™s alignment with the specific components of the referendum's proposals.
