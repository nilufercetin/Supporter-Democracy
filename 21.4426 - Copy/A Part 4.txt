Certainly! Here are the voting recommendations based on the provided measurements for each person:

1. **Person at age 65:** This individual has moderate scores across all axes, leaning slightly towards maintaining law and order and somewhat conservative financial policies, with less enthusiasm for liberal societal norms. Given the moderate support for law and order and the referendum's focus on standardizing a process that impacts public administration, this person should vote **yes**.

2. **Person at age 34:** With a low score on Law and Order and high on Liberal Society, this person values personal freedoms and minimal governmental control, which may conflict with the idea of a national system that could impact personal data handling. Therefore, this person should vote **no**.

3. **Person at age 62:** The scores indicate a moderate inclination towards law and order and somewhat liberal societal values. This person might see the benefit in a standardized system that could bring efficiency but also be wary of overreach. The slight preference for law and order suggests a vote of **yes** might be more aligned with their views.

4. **Person at age 49:** With a strong preference for law and order and moderate scores on the other scales, this person likely supports initiatives that bring about national consistency and enhanced security measures, which aligns with the aims of the referendum. Therefore, they should vote **yes**.

5. **Person at age 41:** This individual has fairly balanced views but leans towards a structured approach in law and finance, which may align with the goals of the referendum to standardize data handling. Voting **yes** would be consistent with their preferences.

6. **Person at age 45:** Similar to the previous, this person's moderate scores across the board with a slight lean towards liberal society values suggest a balanced view but with a readiness for standardized changes that may improve efficiency. A vote of **yes** would align with their likely views on improvement and structure.

7. **Person at age 43:** This person's strong support for law and order combined with moderate views on financial restriction indicates a preference for regulatory frameworks and efficient management, aligning well with the referendum's goals. They should vote **yes**.

8. **Person at age 56:** With very low support for law and order and high scores for liberal societal values, this person likely values personal freedoms and minimal state interference, which may make them skeptical of national data systems. They should vote **no**.

9. **Person at age 49:** Moderate scores with a slight lean towards conservative values in all areas suggest this person might appreciate the efficiency a standardized system could bring but is not strongly inclined towards heavy regulation. A cautious **yes** might suit their views.

10. **Person at age 42:** With strong law and order inclinations and less enthusiasm for liberal society values, this person would likely support measures that enhance national consistency and security, aligning well with the referendum's aims. They should vote **yes**.

11. **Person at age 55:** Moderate preferences with a balance between all axes suggest this person might appreciate a standardized approach to enhance system efficiency, which aligns with the referendum's objectives. They should vote **yes**.

12. **Person at age 43:** A strong inclination towards liberal society values with minimal support for law and order suggests this person values personal freedoms and may be wary of national data systems. They should vote **no**.

13. **Person at age 56:** Moderate to strong preferences for law and order with less emphasis on liberal society values suggest a preference for structure and consistency, which aligns with the referendum. They should vote **yes**.

14. **Person at age 59:** Balanced yet leaning towards a structured financial approach with moderate liberal values, this person might see the benefits of a standardized national system for efficiency and better management. They should vote **yes**.

15. **Person at age 39:** Strong law and order preference combined with a structured financial viewpoint suggests this person supports initiatives that enhance regulatory frameworks and efficiency. They should vote **yes**.

16. **Person at age 36:** Low law and order score combined with high liberal society values suggests a preference for minimal government control and maximum personal freedoms, which might conflict with the goals of the referendum. They should vote **no**.

17. **Person at age 56:** With a preference for liberal society values and a moderate stance on law and order, this person might favor less governmental oversight, which conflicts with the referendum's goals. They should vote **no**.

18. **Person at age 61:** Moderate to high scores on all axes suggest a preference for balance but with a slight inclination towards structured systems. They might see the value in a standardized approach. They should vote **yes**.

19. **Person at age 51:** Strong law and order preference with moderate scores on the other axes suggest a support for measures that enhance national consistency and security, aligning well with the referendum's aims. They should vote **yes**.

20. **Analysis:** With a low score on Law and Order and high scores on Liberal Society, this person values personal freedoms and minimal governmental interference. Given the focus of the referendum on implementing a national digital solution, which could be seen as increasing government oversight, their inclination toward liberal values suggests a preference against measures that might standardize or centralize control, even if it's for efficiency.

**Recommendation:** Based on their high regard for liberal societal values and lower support for law and order, this person should vote **no** on the referendum, as it could conflict with their preference for minimal governmental intervention and maximum personal freedoms.
