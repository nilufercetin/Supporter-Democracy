Here are the voting recommendations based on the given measurements and the outlined referendum:

1. **Person at age 42** - The scores suggest a moderate stance towards restrictive immigration and a low priority for welfare expansion, but a slightly higher regard for liberal societal values. Given the moderate concern for immigration restriction, **the person should vote no** on the referendum focusing on reducing discrimination in housing, which likely aligns less with their moderate-to-low liberal values.

2. **Person at age 62** - With a high score on restrictive immigration, and lower scores on liberal society and expanded welfare, **the person should vote no**, as their views are more aligned with maintaining current structures rather than implementing new measures that facilitate integration.

3. **Person at age 40** - This person supports low restrictive immigration, high liberal societal values, and a very strong support for expanded welfare. **The person should vote yes**, as the referendum aims to reduce societal divisions which aligns with their values.

4. **Person at age 52** - High restrictive immigration values and lower scores on liberal societal values and expanded welfare suggest a preference for less change. **The person should vote no**, as the referendum's aim to introduce more inclusive housing measures may not align with their views.

5. **Person at age 61** - Very high restrictive immigration values and low liberal society and welfare state scores indicate a strong preference for maintaining the status quo and restricting integration measures, **the person should vote no** on the referendum.
