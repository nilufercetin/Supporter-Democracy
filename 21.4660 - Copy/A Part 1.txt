Certainly! Let's look at each individual's scores and their implication for voting on the referendum that concerns surveillance and privacy:

1. **Person at age 42**: With balanced scores around the midpoint for both Liberal Society and Law and Order (3.26 and 3.33 respectively), this individual has moderate views both on personal freedoms and state security measures. Given the moderate alignment with both axes, they should lean slightly towards a "yes" vote, favoring a balanced approach to privacy protection and law enforcement. **The person should vote yes**.

2. **Person at age 40**: This individual strongly values liberal societal norms (4.69) and has minimal concern for increased law enforcement (1.25). The referendum's focus on restricting surveillance to protect personal freedoms aligns well with their values. **The person should vote yes**.

3. **Person at age 52**: With a lower score on Liberal Society (2.44) and a slightly higher preference for Law and Order (3.5), this individual leans more towards state intervention. However, the referendum aims at protection against surveillance, which might not fully align with their views. **The person should vote no**.

4. **Person at age 61**: With a very low score in Liberal Society (2.23) and a maximum score in Law and Order (5.0), this person strongly supports increased security measures and might see the surveillance as a necessary tool for public safety. **The person should vote no**.

5. **Person at age 29**: The scores indicate a strong leaning towards liberal values (4.08) and a moderate stance on Law and Order (2.5). This individual would likely support measures that protect against surveillance overreach. **The person should vote yes**.

6. **Person at age 62**: With high scores in Liberal Society (3.95) and moderate scores in Law and Order (2.46), this voter likely values personal freedoms slightly more than stringent law enforcement. **The person should vote yes**.

7. **Person at age 51**: This person has a high Liberal Society score (4.54) and low Law and Order score (1.25), indicating strong liberal values with little emphasis on heightened security measures. **The person should vote yes**.

8. **Person at age 59**: With a high Liberal Society score (4.56) and low Law and Order score (1.46), this individual highly values personal freedoms and would likely support measures to protect privacy. **The person should vote yes**.

9. **Person at age 55**: High scores in Liberal Society (4.38) and relatively low in Law and Order (1.62) suggest a strong preference for protecting individual freedoms over enhanced surveillance. **The person should vote yes**.

10. **Person at age 47**: With a somewhat balanced but leaning towards Liberal Society (2.59) and high Law and Order (3.96), this individual may have mixed feelings but the high concern for Law and Order suggests a slight leaning towards "no" as they may value the security aspects of surveillance. **The person should vote no**.

11. **Person at age 43**: This individual shows a strong inclination towards Liberal Society (3.98) but is less stringent on Law and Order (1.83). They likely prioritize personal freedoms and privacy, aligning well with the referendum’s aim to limit surveillance. **The person should vote yes**.

12. **Person at age 58**: With a high Liberal Society score (4.38) and a lower Law and Order score (2.12), this person values personal freedoms significantly, suggesting a strong alignment with the referendum's goals of protecting privacy. **The person should vote yes**.

13. **Person at age 55**: Moderate to high scores in Liberal Society (3.72) combined with a moderate Law and Order score (2.71) suggest a balance, but with a leaning towards valuing personal freedoms. This individual is likely to support measures that enhance privacy protections. **The person should vote yes**.

14. **Person at age 32**: This individual has a moderate score on Liberal Society (2.9) and a slightly higher score on Law and Order (3.12), indicating a balanced view but with a slight preference for security measures. They might be slightly conflicted but could lean towards a "no" given their slight preference for security measures. **The person should vote no**.

15. **Person at age 41**: Scores indicate a moderate preference for Liberal Society (2.67) with a stronger preference for Law and Order (3.88), suggesting a concern for security that might outweigh their liberal values. **The person should vote no**.

16. **Person at age 61**: A low Liberal Society score (1.66) coupled with a high Law and Order score (3.96) indicates a preference for security and potential support for surveillance measures. **The person should vote no**.

17. **Person at age 66**: The scores indicate a strong preference for Liberal Society (3.92) and a lesser concern for Law and Order (1.88). This individual likely values personal freedoms highly and would support measures to protect privacy. **The person should vote yes**.

18. **Person at age 69**: High scores in Liberal Society (4.41) and low in Law and Order (1.46) clearly suggest strong liberal values and a preference for protecting individual freedoms over enhancing surveillance. **The person should vote yes**.

20. **Person at age 37**: Strong Liberal Society scores (4.31) and very low Law and Order scores (1.25) indicate a strong inclination towards protecting personal freedoms and privacy, aligning well with the aims of the referendum. **The person should vote yes**.
