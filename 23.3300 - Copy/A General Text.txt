Hi. I will be asking you about how different people should vote on a referendum text I will provide. The people I will ask voting recommendation for will be characterized by their scores in 1 axis. I will now outline you the meaning and the range of scores in this axis.

1. Liberal Economy: The score reflects views on privatization, state institution autonomy in essential services (e.g., healthcare, education, food supply), reducing restrictive regulations, promoting competition, and sector-specific subsidies. On a scale from 1 to 5, score of 5 indicates strong support for privatization and unrestricted competition in all sectors, while a score of 1 signifies advocating for state ownership and government-led production and services.

I will also provide a text summary of the referendum as well. 

The referendum aims to modify the legislation so that the cantons and municipalities can periodically check if the rents collected in their territory comply with the law and that lessors do not obtain abusive rental returns by charging excessive rents. The controls should ofcourse take into account the differences between various categories.

I will now give out the personal measurements the axis in lists of people. I would be happy if you could provide analysis as  a few sentences and a final sentence as the person should vote 'yes' or 'no'. Please make sure your analysis and reasoning are sound, coherent, unbiased and inline with the referendum, measurements, axis descriptions and relevance of axes.
