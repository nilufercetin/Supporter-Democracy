1. **Person 1 (Age 37)**: With strong support for Open Foreign Policy, the person aligns with the referendum's goals on transparency in foreign investments. Lower scores in other areas might reflect concerns about enforcement but not enough to negate their primary stance. **The person should vote yes.**

4. **Person 4 (Age 42)**: Moderate support for Open Foreign Policy and low scores in other areas suggest some alignment with the referendum’s focus, though with reservations. **The person should vote yes.**

5. **Person 5 (Age 41)**: Low Open Foreign Policy score and high scores in Law and Order indicate a preference for more controlled and internal-focused policies, conflicting with the referendum's aims. **The person should vote no.**

16. **Person 16 (Age 39)**: Lower support for Open Foreign Policy but higher scores in other areas indicate a preference for more stringent internal controls rather than openness, which might be in conflict with the referendum. **The person should vote no.**

17. **Person 17 (Age 59)**: Very high Open Foreign Policy score indicates a strong alignment with the referendum's objectives, despite moderate scores in other areas. **The person should vote yes.**
