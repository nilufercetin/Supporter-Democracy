Hi. I will be asking you about how different people should vote on a referendum text I will provide. The people I will ask voting recommendation for will be characterized by their scores in 2 different axes. I will now outline you the meaning and the range of scores of each axis.

1. Expanded Welfare State: The score reflects individuals' attitudes towards the extent and accessibility of state social benefits, as well as government social programs. It also encompasses perspectives on promoting private retirement savings and social responsibility. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 suggests advocating for expanded and affordable public services across all areas, while a score of 1 indicates a belief that it's not the state's responsibility to provide such benefits, and individuals should be self-reliant. 

2. Restrictive Financial Policy: The score reflects the attitudes towards government spending proposals, including austerity measures, budget changes, and tax adjustments. On a scale from 1 to 5, a score of 5 indicates advocating for restricted spending across all sectors, while a score of 1 suggests advocating for increased government spending to enhance citizen access to services. 

Previously, the referendum text is analyzed and it has found out that the axis Expanded Welfare State is the most related to the referendum with a score of 0.55/1, while the axis Restrictive Financial Policy is related to the referendum with a relation score of 0.45/1. Now that you know about the axes, I will also provide a text summary of the referendum as well. 

The initiative aims to increase the AVS retirement pension by one monthly pension. A thirteenth pension would thus be added each year to the twelve monthly pensions. These costs would then increase rapidly. The initiative does not answer the question of financing. Various reforms have made it possible to consolidate the financing of AVS benefits. However, a deficit should be expected after 2030.

I will now give out the personal measurements in each axis in lists of people. I would be happy if you could provide analysis as  a few sentences and a final sentence as the person should vote 'yes' or 'no'. Please make sure your analysis and reasoning are sound, coherent, unbiased and inline with the referendum, measurements, axis descriptions and relevance of axes.
