Here are the voting recommendations based on each person's alignment with the referendum on banning cash payments in real estate transactions to combat money laundering:

2. **Person at age 33**: Low scores across all axes suggest a preference against increased government intervention and regulation. This person is likely to view the referendum as an unnecessary imposition. **The person should vote no**.

6. **Person at age 60**: High scores in all axes, especially in Liberal Economy, suggest a preference for strong controls and regulations, which align with the referendum's measures. **The person should vote yes**.

7. **Person at age 32**: Very low scores across the axes indicate opposition to strict regulations and a likely preference for less government intervention, opposing the referendum's measures. **The person should vote no**.
